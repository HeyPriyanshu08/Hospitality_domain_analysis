# AtliQ Grands Data Analysis in the Hospitality Domain
This project centers on the development of a revenue analysis dashboard. The primary goal is to empower the revenue team with data-driven insights for more effective business analysis.
In this project I have created various KPIs and metrics using dax functions.
Most Important Metrics:
RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room): A key indicator of hotel performance.
Occupancy: Measuring room occupancy among all available rooms.
ADR (Average Daily Rate): Calculating the average rate paid for rooms sold.
DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights): Reflecting the rooms ready for sale.
DBRN (Daily Booked Room Nights): Tracking rooms booked per night, including cancellations and no-shows.
Cancellations: Analyzing customer cancellations, leading to a 40% refund.
No Show: Identifying cases where customers neither canceled nor arrived.
DURN (Daily Utilized Room Nights): Quantifying rooms utilized per night.
